Explanation of Cycle Counting:

Cycle counting is a method of inventory auditing where a small subset of inventory is counted on a regular, ongoing basis. Unlike a full physical inventory, which can be disruptive and time-consuming, cycle counting allows for more frequent and less intrusive checks on inventory accuracy. The goal is to identify and correct discrepancies between the physical inventory and the system records in a timely manner, leading to more reliable inventory data.

Multiple Features of Cycle Counting with Detailed Acceptance Criteria and "Given, When, Then" Examples:

Here are five key features of cycle counting within a WMS:

1. Cycle Count Scheduling

Feature Description: Allows warehouse managers to define and manage schedules for cycle counts based on various criteria.
Acceptance Criteria:
The system allows users to create cycle count schedules with definable frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Users can schedule cycle counts based on specific criteria such as:
Product Category: Count all items within a specific product group.
Storage Location: Count all items within a designated warehouse zone or bin.
Item Velocity (ABC Analysis): Count high-velocity (A) items more frequently than medium (B) or low (C) velocity items.
Random Selection: Count a randomly selected sample of items.
User-Defined Criteria: Allow for custom criteria based on specific needs.
The system automatically generates cycle count tasks based on the defined schedules.
Users can view and manage upcoming and completed cycle count schedules.
The system allows for manual initiation of ad-hoc cycle counts outside of scheduled times.
Example Functionality:
Given: A warehouse manager wants to cycle count all "Electronics" category items weekly.
When: The manager creates a new cycle count schedule, selects "Weekly" frequency, and filters by "Product Category = Electronics".
Then: The system automatically generates cycle count tasks for all items classified as "Electronics" at the beginning of each week.
2. Cycle Count Task Generation and Assignment

Feature Description: Enables the system to create specific tasks for warehouse staff to perform the physical counts and allows for assignment of these tasks.
Acceptance Criteria:
The system automatically generates cycle count tasks based on the defined schedules or manual initiation.
Each cycle count task clearly identifies the items to be counted (SKU, description, location).
Warehouse managers can assign cycle count tasks to specific users or teams.
Users can view their assigned cycle count tasks through the system (e.g., on a mobile device).
The system allows for prioritization of cycle count tasks.
The system tracks the status of each cycle count task (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
Example Functionality:
Given: A weekly cycle count schedule for high-velocity items has been triggered.
When: The system generates 20 individual cycle count tasks for various high-velocity items in different locations.
Then: The system assigns these 20 tasks to available warehouse staff members, and each staff member can see their assigned tasks on their mobile WMS application.
3. Cycle Count Data Entry and Confirmation

Feature Description: Provides a user-friendly interface for warehouse staff to record the physical count and confirm the accuracy.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can access their assigned cycle count tasks through the WMS interface (e.g., mobile app).
The system displays the expected item details (SKU, description, location) for each task.
Users can enter the actual counted quantity for each item.
The system allows for scanning of barcodes to verify the correct item and location.
Users can add notes or comments related to the count (e.g., damaged goods, discrepancies).
The system provides a clear indication of whether the counted quantity matches the system quantity.
Users can submit their completed cycle counts through the system.
Example Functionality:
Given: A warehouse staff member has been assigned a cycle count task for "SKU-ABC" in location "Aisle 01, Rack 02, Bin 03".
When: The staff member navigates to the task on their mobile device, scans the barcode of "SKU-ABC" at the specified location, and physically counts 10 units. They enter "10" as the counted quantity.
Then: The system records the counted quantity for that task and indicates whether it matches the expected quantity in the system.
4. Discrepancy Review and Adjustment

Feature Description: Enables warehouse managers to review any discrepancies found during cycle counts and make necessary adjustments to the inventory records.
Acceptance Criteria:
The system flags cycle count tasks where the counted quantity does not match the system quantity.
Warehouse managers can access a list of cycle count discrepancies, including item details, location, system quantity, counted quantity, and any notes.
The system provides options for investigating discrepancies (e.g., reviewing recent transactions).
Authorized users can approve or reject the proposed inventory adjustments based on the cycle count results.
Upon approval, the system automatically updates the inventory records to reflect the accurate counted quantity.
The system maintains an audit trail of all cycle count adjustments, including who made the adjustment and when.
Example Functionality:
Given: A cycle count for "SKU-XYZ" in location "B05-R01-B08" shows a system quantity of 50 but a counted quantity of 48.
When: The warehouse manager reviews the discrepancy report and investigates the recent transactions for "SKU-XYZ". After confirming the physical count is correct, they approve the adjustment.
Then: The system updates the inventory record for "SKU-XYZ" at location "B05-R01-B08" to 48, and a record of this adjustment is logged in the system's audit trail.
5. Cycle Count Reporting and Analysis

Feature Description: Provides reports and analytics to track the performance and accuracy of the cycle counting process.
Acceptance Criteria:
The system can generate reports on cycle count completion rates (e.g., percentage of scheduled counts completed).
Reports show the accuracy of cycle counts (e.g., percentage of counts with zero discrepancies, average discrepancy rate).
Users can filter cycle count reports by date range, product category, storage location, user, and other relevant criteria.
The system provides insights into the root causes of inventory discrepancies based on cycle count data.
Reports can be exported in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, PDF).
The system may include dashboards to visualize key cycle counting metrics.
Example Functionality:
Given: The warehouse manager wants to assess the effectiveness of the weekly high-velocity item cycle count schedule over the past month.
When: The manager generates a cycle count performance report for the last four weeks, filtering by the "High Velocity" item category.
Then: The report shows that 95% of scheduled high-velocity item counts were completed, with an average discrepancy rate of 1.5%, indicating a generally accurate inventory for these critical items.
