When scaling operations (Use Case 9), routes adapt within 5 seconds of new order inputs, maintaining 95% on-time delivery.
Negative Scenarios:
If traffic data is unavailable, the system uses cached data to provide routes with ≤10% deviation from optimal, notifying users of potential delays.
When a road is blocked unexpectedly, the system reroutes within 10 seconds, ensuring no delivery is delayed >15 minutes.
Feature 2: Predictive Supply Chain Resilience
Positive Scenarios:
During a flood (Use Case 3) or bushfire (Use Case 5), the system predicts disruptions ≥48 hours ahead with ≥90% accuracy, suggesting reroutes that avoid ≥80% of impacted areas.
For export compliance (Use Case 8), it adjusts schedules proactively, ensuring 100% of deadlines are met.
Negative Scenarios:
If weather data fails, the system uses historical patterns to predict with ≥70% accuracy, alerting users to potential risks.
When a prediction is incorrect, the system logs the error and adjusts models within 24 hours, minimizing future misses.
Feature 3: Sustainable AI-Driven Operations
Positive Scenarios:
During peak season (Use Case 1) or traffic management (Use Case 10), the system consolidates loads, reducing emissions by ≥20% and energy use by ≥15%.
For export compliance (Use Case 8), it provides carbon tracking accurate to ±5%, securing regulatory approval.
Negative Scenarios:
If carbon data is incomplete, the system estimates emissions with ≤10% error, flagging gaps for manual review.
When load consolidation fails (e.g., incompatible goods), it notifies users within 5 minutes, offering alternative routes.
Feature 4: Integrated Cybersecurity Suite
Positive Scenarios:
During airport freight integration (Use Case 2) or new market entry (Use Case 6), the system detects ≥98% of threats within 60 seconds, preventing breaches 100% of the time.
All client data remains encrypted, passing Australian privacy audits with zero violations.
Negative Scenarios:
If a breach attempt succeeds, the system locks affected data within 30 seconds, notifying admins and isolating the issue.
When network connectivity drops, local encryption holds, ensuring no data loss for ≥24 hours.
Feature 5: Multi-Modal Logistics Orchestration
Positive Scenarios:
For airport integration (Use Case 2) or peak overload (Use Case 7), the system coordinates road, drone, and air transport, reducing transit times by ≥25% and maintaining 90% API uptime.
During traffic management (Use Case 10), it balances modes, cutting congestion by ≥20%.
Negative Scenarios:
If drone connectivity fails, the system shifts to road within 15 minutes, notifying users of delays ≤10%.
When airport data is delayed, it uses cached schedules, ensuring ≤5% error in freight planning.
Feature 6: SME-Centric Customization and Affordability
Positive Scenarios:
For peak surge (Use Case 1) or new market entry (Use Case 6), the system deploys in ≤2 weeks, costing ≤$2,000/month, achieving ≥85% client retention.
When scaling (Use Case 9), modular tools adapt to 50 deliveries/day without performance lag.
Negative Scenarios:
If setup exceeds 2 weeks, the system flags delays and offers free support until complete.
When a client cancels, it exports their data within 24 hours, ensuring compliance and goodwill.
Feature 7: Digital Twin for Scenario Planning
Positive Scenarios:
During airport integration (Use Case 2) or peak overload (Use Case 7), the system simulates scenarios with ≥90% accuracy, reducing planning errors by ≥40%.
For supply chain disruption (Use Case 3), it recommends adjustments adopted by ≥80% of users.
Negative Scenarios:
If client data is insufficient, the system generates a partial twin with ≥70% accuracy, notifying users of limitations.
When a simulation fails, it logs the issue and recalibrates within 48 hours.
Feature 8: Autonomous Fleet Integration
Positive Scenarios:
For fuel cost spike (Use Case 4) or scaling (Use Case 9), the system integrates with 5 autonomous vehicles by 2030, reducing maintenance downtime by ≥30%.
During peak overload (Use Case 7), it coordinates mixed fleets with ≥95% accuracy.
Negative Scenarios:
If an autonomous vehicle malfunctions, the system reroutes to human drivers within 20 minutes, minimizing delays ≤10%.
When regulations block autonomy, it defaults to manual mode seamlessly, notifying admins.
Feature 9: Real-Time Client Dashboard with AI Insights
Positive Scenarios:
Across all use cases (e.g., Use Case 1, 4, 7), the system updates delivery status with ≤5-second latency, achieving ≥90% client satisfaction.
During disaster response (Use Case 5), AI insights (e.g., “Shift to drones”) are followed by ≥80% of users.
Negative Scenarios:
If connectivity drops, the dashboard caches data for ≥12 hours, syncing once restored.
When insights are unclear, it prompts user feedback, refining suggestions within 24 hours.
Feature 10: Partnerships and Ecosystem Integration
Positive Scenarios:
For disaster response (Use Case 5) or export compliance (Use Case 8), the system integrates council/airport data, improving feature accuracy by ≥15%.
During traffic management (Use Case 10), it secures ≥3 partnerships by 2026, unlocking $200K in grants.
Negative Scenarios:
If partner data is unavailable, the system uses internal models with ≤10% accuracy drop, notifying users.
When a partnership delays, it flags risks and adjusts timelines within 48 hours.
